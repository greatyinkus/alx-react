string-hash
A fast string hashing function for Node.JS. The particular algorithm is quite similar to djb2, by Dan Bernstein and available here. Differences include iterating over the string backwards (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR operator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and because it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).
